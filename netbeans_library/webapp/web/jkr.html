        <p> J.K. Rowling</p>
        <p>
        J. K. Rowling, born in 1965, British author, who writes about the magical adventures of a boy wizard named Harry Potter. 
        The Harry Potter book series dominated bestseller lists beginning in the late 1990s, attracting millions of fans worldwide among children and adults alike.</p>
        <p>
       Like that of her own character, Harry Potter, J.K. Rowling's life has the luster of a fairy tale. 
       Divorced, living on public assistance in a tiny Edinburgh flat with her infant daughter, Rowling wrote
       Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone at a table in a cafe during her daughter's naps — and it was
       Harry Potter that rescued her.</p>
        <p>
       Joanne Kathleen Rowling entered the world in Chipping Sodbury General Hospital in Bristol, England, 
       a fitting beginning for someone who would later enjoy making up strange names for people, places and games played on flying broomsticks.
       Her younger sister Di was born just under two years later.</p>
        <p>
       Rowling remembers that she always wanted to write and that the first story she actually wrote down, when she was five or six, 
       was a story about a rabbit called Rabbit. Many of her favorite memories center around reading—
       hearing The Wind in the Willows read aloud by her father when she had the measles, enjoying the fantastic adventure stories of E. Nesbit,
       reveling in the magical world of C. S. Lewis's Narnia, and her favorite story of all, The Little White Horse by Elizabeth Goudge.</p>
